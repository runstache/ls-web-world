#### About Me

My name is Larry. I've been working in the technology field for about 20 years now. I started out as a simple technician replacing hardware and installing printer drivers. I know it sounds like a glamorous lifestyle full of international travel and intrigue but I soon found my way into Product Management. After a stint running cross functional teams in the product space, I've moved on to the fun world of Data Engineering.

Previously this site had a pretty large backend and I've decided to try scaling it back to run mainly on Markdown files, basic JQuery and Bootstrap. My goal is to have a working site that I can wasily publish interesting content to as well as things I'd like to not forget.
